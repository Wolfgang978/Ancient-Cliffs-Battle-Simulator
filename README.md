Link to Heroku Deployment: https://ancient-cliffs-85623.herokuapp.com/

Upon arrival of the main page you'll be prompted to either sign in or signup. After signing in, the homepage will be render and there is three options to select - View All Characters (which includes 4 hardcoded characters), Create A Character and Battle. For the Create A Character you'll be presented with multiple questions to generate skills and attributes, clicking 'submit' saves your created characters and attaches it to your user, the page will then be redirected to View All Characters where your newley created character will be shown along with the others. The battle function invokes a "Dungeon & Dragons like" attack sequence that is based off a random dice roll.
